The Algorithmic Beauty
of Plants

When each piece of a shape is geometrically similar to the
whole, both the shape and the cascade that generate it are
called self-similar

D’Arcy Thompson [143] traces its
origins to the late seventeenth century, and comments:
Organic form itself is found, mathematically speaking, to be
a function of time.... We might call the form of an organism
an event in space-time, and not merely a configuration in
space.
This concept is echoed by Hall ́e, Oldeman and Tomlinson [58]:
The idea of the form implicitly contains also the history of
such a form.

Can the human familarity with the concept of growing plants be used to convey otherwise abstract informationen of unknown terrain? 
To illuminate this subject, this paper aims to visualise the linux filesystem as a root-to-leafs plant and gives the user the means to explore 
and manipulate this simulation freely. The evaluation is conducted by exposing unfamiliar users with the traditional window/terminal based system and 
the 3d visualisation and given simple tasks to measure the ease of usability.

No 3D Mesh for Text, but instead we are building a texture atlas that holds all the strings to directories and files 
one over the other, then mapping there UV coordinates to the appropriate leaf vertices.

3D Visualisation
The process of visualisation consists of two main pillars, one is its geometry, represented by the generated mesh, the other 
is information, coded in color and symbols, which is encapsulated through a generated texture atlas that maps all these 
informations via UV - Coordinates onto the meshes vertices.

Fixing the camera-roll manover with the ground surface helps to orient the displayed text in an allways readable format.

Should deeper nested folders allways strive towards the "sky" / upwards? That way, the files could be hanging from respective
folders.

Form/visual structure of the folder-"leaf" could represent information about how many files / how big they are. 
The leafs colour could represent how recent it had seen interaction? 
    Clicking the folder leaf should render the file-fruits

        But folder are more like the branches, files the leafs, but if we only render the leafs by clicking, we get dead trees.

Interaction should be afterrendered for anymation and things like these? 

What about our nice, rotating trees we got with lindenmayer?

A comparison of variable approaches to data visualisation using procedual mesh and texture generation. As research question?


Depending on the amount of subfoldersx, spreading angle and branch length are adjusted, whereby branchlength is inverse propotional
tho the spreading angle -> Less folders, bigger spread, less branch length needed to keep it "overviewable".

The more files, the smaller the leafs?
